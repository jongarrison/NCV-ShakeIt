# EMF Detecting Time Delayed Relay With Audio Feedback

Uses a high impedence wire antenna to detect 60Hz AC power (EMF) like commonly available Noncontact Voltage detectors (NCV)

When EMF is detected for longer than some minimum amount of time, an MP3 file is played (using DFPlayer Mini, DFR0299) and after a delay two relays are activated.
